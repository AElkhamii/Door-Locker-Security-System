Notes for the project Delivery:

-Implement a full Timer0 driver to support both Normal and Compare modes using interrupt and call-back.
-Implement buzzer driver.

-Update the I2C driver Initialization function with the configuration structure two members.
-Other drivers should be same as the one used in the course sessions.
-Use the layered model in both MCU projects.






Done:

-Update the UART driver Initialization function with the configuration structure four members.
1- Normal mode or fast mode
2- Asynchronous Operation of Synchronous Operation
3- Parity Mode
4- UCSZ Bits Settings
